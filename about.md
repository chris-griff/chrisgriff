Where to begin...

I've been fascinated by the concepts and theories that drive business as far back as I can remember - especially when it comes to marketing.

After graduating from the <a href="http://www.udel.edu">University of Delaware</a>, I joined the team at <a href="http://www.wizehive.com">WizeHive</a> as Director of Marketing - contributing all I can in terms of content, digital, search, email, conversion, social, and growth marketing. By no means do I consider myself an expert in any of these arenas, but I'm passionate about each one.

A lot of it was luck. I couldn't have picked a better time to embark on a career in this radically changing,expanding, and growing field, where so many new strategies and platforms are being embraced and encouraged (what seems like) everyday.

And what a ride it's been. Just a few months removed from the classroom, would've thought I'd be where I am today; but I'm loving every minute of it.

I'll use this blog as a venue for sharing things I pick up along the way, hopefully you find something here that is helpful, or at the very least,

Cheers,<br/>
Christopher
